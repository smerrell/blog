# The Problem

How do you get a promotion or a raise at work? For me, that option used to
consist of either going out and getting a new job or getting an offer and hoping
to get a counter offer. A few years back my employer decided that we should do
something about this problem. We had lost several promising early-career
developers because they didn't see any way to progress in their career or to get
a raise.

So we decided to create what was called the Leveling Process. We've gone through
several iterations on the process but I'd like to describe how we do things
currently and see how other companies have approached this problem.

## Our Approach

Where I work is a development organization using C# / .NET and JavaScript so the
process we build revolves heavily around these two stacks.

### The Levels

To begin, we first needed to work through titles for our leveling so that HR
would be more open to giving developers a raise. To that end, we have come up
with what we call Levels. We have four levels currently they are simply ordered
like so:

* Level 1
* Level 2
* Level 3
* Mastery

Each level has a set of criteria that a developer needs to pass off to show
progress that they've made. As they make progress on their leveling, they become
eligible for raises.

#### The Criteria

Under each of those levels we have assembled criteria to pass of in order to
show technical progression. Here is a sampling of some of the criteria that we
have.

*C# Criteria examples*
*JavaScript Criteria examples*

### The Review Panel

When a developer feels they have enough criteria to pass off they speak to
their manager about scheduling a review panel. The purpose of the Review
Panel is for the developer, their manager, and their technical leads to talk
about the criteria and determine if they've shown a sufficient level of
knowledge in the criteria.

### Using GitHub

Our process is driven through GitHub. Each developer has a copy of the leveling
criteria created for them in an individual repo that is visible to only the
developer, their manager, and their technical leadership. This gives the
developers much better visibility into their progress. It also allows for an
additional benefit by using GitHub â€” Issues. Developers are encouraged to open
GitHub issues on their repository providing any notes or examples of how they
meet the criteria they are trying to pass off. This has been extremely helpful
because it lets the developer and their technical leadership discuss the
criteria asynchronously and make sure the developer is prepared for the Review
Panel.

What do other companies do to encourage skills improvement of their developers
and give them a path to getting appropriately compensated for their skills? Let
me know in the comments!
